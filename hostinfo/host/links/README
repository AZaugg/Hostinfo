Scripts that are executable in this directory will generate links in the hostinfo web pages
The script needs to take one argument which is the hostname involved
It then needs to output space separated strings to stdout. The first is the URL the rest are the text tag
Return code should be 0 for success, or 1 for don't include link

If he script starts with 'bulk_' it will get invoked once with no arguments. It should generate its own list of hosts and output "host url tag" for every host

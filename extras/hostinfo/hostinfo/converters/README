This directory is to hold files that describe the keys that are
stored in hostinfo, what else they are called and how to convert
to them. This is primarily used for handling the importing of
spreadsheets and other sources of data into hostinfo.

The files should be named 'key_<KEYNAME>.py' and should contain two things

* a list called 'aka' which contains other names used for this key
* a function called 'convert' which should convert the supplied string into the value to be used for the key
